## Created by Kito

Custom boot-up screen videos for retro handheld gaming devices.

## About This Project

I create custom boot-up MP4 videos for retro handheld gaming systems. Currently focusing on the R36S handheld with more devices planned in the future.

## Current Boot Screens

- 2 custom boot screens for the R36S

## Format

All boot screens are created as MP4 videos designed to match the specific requirements of each supported device.

## Installation Instructions (R36S)

1. Download the boot screen MP4
2. Place the file on your device's SD card in the appropriate folder
3. Rename as needed according to your firmware
4. Restart your device to see the new boot video

## Coming Up

Working on more boot screens for additional devices. Check back for updates!
